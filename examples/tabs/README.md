# Tabs

The `<buche-tabs>` element can be used to create tabbed navigation. These tabs can be anchored at the top, bottom, left or right, and they can be nested.

If you hold shift when clicking tabs, you can select more than one at the same time.

## Run the example:

    buche --inspect python tabs.py
