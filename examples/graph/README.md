# Graphs

Graphs can be displayed using the `buche-cytoscape` plugin. That plugin is not installed by default. You can install it via command line as follows:

    buche --install cytoscape

Alternatively, you can just run the example and install the plugin from the GUI.

## Run the example:

    buche -v node graph.js
